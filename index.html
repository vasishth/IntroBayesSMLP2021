<br><br>

<h4>Overview and schedule</h4>

 In recent years, Bayesian methods have come to be widely adopted in all areas of science. This is in large part due to the development of sophisticated software for probabilisic programming; a recent example is the astonishing computing capability afforded by the language Stan (mc-stan.org). However, the underlying theory needed to use this software sensibly is often inaccessible because end-users don't necessarily have the statistical and mathematical background to read the primary textbooks (such as Gelman et al's classic Bayesian data analysis, 3rd edition). In this course, we seek to cover this gap, by providing a relatively accessible and technically non-demanding introduction to the basic workflow for fitting different kinds of linear models using Stan. To illustrate the capability of Bayesian modeling, we will use the R package RStan and a powerful front-end R package for Stan called brms.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

We assume familiarity with R. Participants will benefit most if they have previously fit linear models and linear mixed models (using lme4) in R, in any scientific domain within linguistics and psychology. No knowledge of calculus or linear algebra is assumed (but will be helpful to know), but basic school level mathematics knowledge is assumed (this will be quickly revisited in class). 

<br><br>

<h4>Please install the following software before coming to the course</h4>

We will be using the software <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>,
and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>,
 so make sure you install these on your computer.  
You should also install the R package <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started">rstan</a>; the R package <a href="https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms">brms</a>. <strong>Please follow the installation instructions carefully</strong>.


<br><br>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>

After completing this course, the participant will have become familiar with the foundations of Bayesian inference using Stan (RStan and brms, but mostly the latter), and will be able to fit a range of multiple regression models and hierarchical models, for normally distributed data, and for lognormal and Binomially distributed data. They will know how to calibrate their models using prior and posterior predictive checks; they will be able to establish true and false discovery rates to validate discovery claims. 

<br><br>

<h4>Course materials</h4>

We will work through the first six chapters of <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/book/">this book</a>.
<br>

Solutions to exercises are not publicly available; they will only be provided to participants.<br>

I will post zoom recordings of the lectures on this web page.

<strong>Some example articles from our lab and other groups that use Bayesian methods</strong>

A frequently asked question is: how to summarize the results of a Bayesian analysis?
Here are some examples of articles we have published using Bayesian data analysis. Our presentation of results is continuously evolving; there is no fixed answer to the question, how should I display my results? Use your judgement. The most important thing you can do to facilitate understanding of your work is to be open and transparent about your analyses. This means releasing all data and code with the published paper. We will be providing some guidelines on how to do this, in the summer school course.
